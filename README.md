#### Association between Caregiver Beliefs and Experiences and Childhood Immunizations in rural Uganda, 2021

Background:<br>
In 2016, a national health survey in Uganda revealed that about 55% of children aged 12-23 months
received all recommended vaccinations (UBOS, 2018). To explore vaccination coverage in rural areas of western Uganda, 
we analyzed a more recent vaccination survey of children residing with a caregiver in Bugoye sub-county, Uganda.
Data for the study were collected between January 20, 2021 and April 30, 2021 in Bugoye sub-county, Uganda.
Children, 12-23 months of age, are recommended to receive the following vaccines and boosters:
BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guérin), polio, pentadose 1-3 (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, and Hib disease), rotavirus 1-2, and measles (UBOS, 2018).

Data Description:<br>
The Phase 3 dataset is a cross-sectional survey of 1,689 children aged 12–23
months in Bugoye sub-county, capturing vaccination uptake from vaccination cards or self-reports when cards were
unavailable. It includes covariates, covering child characteristics, caregiver
beliefs, and caregiver experiences, potential confounders such as caregiver education, marital status, and household demographics, 
and response rates to vaccination uptake.  We created an additional response variable, indicating full vaccination status based on the eight vaccines
already in the dataset.

Methods example<br>
Subsection: Sociodemographic Factors Associated with Belief and Experience Scores:<br>
To assess sociodemographic factors associated with aggregate belief and experience scores, we used the following nonparametric analyses.
Continuous variables were examined using Kendall’s Tau rank correlation, binary variables were examined using Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and Cohen’s d statistic, and multinomial variables were examined using Kruskal-Wallis test. Following Kruskal-Wallis, Dunn's test was performed for pairwise comparisons between groups that were significantly associated with belief or experience scores. All statistical tests were performed at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Holm’s method was applied to control the Type 1 error rate in Dunn’s test.
